# Stata do file template

Feel free to use this Stata do file template for your
assignments and future research projects. You may modify it to suit your
needs, but keep in mind that it's good practice to include
some type of header information block at the top of your scripts.
Log files, such as the one that is called at the beginning and closed
at the end, are also useful to keep a record of your work.
