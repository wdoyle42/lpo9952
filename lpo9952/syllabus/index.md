# Course Overview

The overview includes an introduction to the course, guidelines on
grading, and required texts.

# Introduction

This course is the first of a three semester series of courses
designed to introduce you to the *practice* of research,
particularly the applied side of quantitative research. The goal of
this course to help you to prepare a paper that can be presented at
a major research conference and, hopefully, submitted to a journal
for publication.

To accomplish this goal, you will choose from among publicly
available datasets. You will identify a research topic, then later a
research question. You will create a dataset using the NCES survey
and other publicly available sources. By the end of the semester,
you will have a properly formatted and cleaned dataset, with
auxiliary information from other sources included. Next semester we
will analyze this dataset. By the end of May, you will complete a
paper based on this analysis.

Along the way, you will develop skills that will be helpful in
future work using any kind of data. This class has a strong emphasis
on using programming skills to aid in the replication of work and to
simplify complex analyses.

# Grading

## Assignments

There will be a total of eleven assignments, which will be graded
pass/fail. All assignments, unless otherwise stated, are due by midnight of the evening before the next class. 
Late assignments will not be accepted. These assignments will account for half of your grade. 
Collaboration on assignments is fine, though many of the assignments will ask you to work with
variables and datasets of your own choosing.

### TOTAL: 50%

## Summary Paper and Codebook

At the end of the semester, you will need to present the results of
your data collection efforts, with a summary paper of no more than
five pages of text, accompanied by properly formatted tables and
graphics. The summary paper and codebook will be due on December
9. You will present your work to the rest of the class on December
9.

### TOTAL: 50%

# Recommended Texts

* Baum, C. (2006). [*An Introduction to Modern Econometrics Using
STATA*](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Econometrics-Using-Stata/dp/1597180130). College Station: STATA Press

* Long, J.S. (2009). [*The Workflow of Data Analysis Using Stata*](http://www.amazon.com/Workflow-Data-Analysis-Using-Stata/dp/1597180475).
College Station: STATA Press

For this semester, both of these books are *optional*. I may
recommend a few chapters from both as the semester progresses, but the
class notes are the only required reading.

# Software

You need to have access to a working version of Stata 14.
Stata is installed on computers on Peabody campus, including our
classroom (Wyatt 130), and on stations in the Peabody library. You
are not required to purchase Stata, but you will need to use it for
class assignments. I strongly recommend, however, that you purchase it.

If you do purchase Stata, you will need at least Stata IC. Vanderbilt
has what's called a gradplan with Stata under which you can purchase
the software at greatly reduced prices. Stata SE is a more powerful
version of Stata that is useful for the larger datasets many of you
may be working with.

# Submission of work

Unless given other instructions, all assignment files should be submitted with the following naming convention,

```
<yymmdd>_<file name>_<lastname>.*
```  

where   

* `yymmdd` is the year, month, and day in two-digit format (e.g., *150901*)
* `file name` describes the file (e.g., *assignment1*)
* `lastname` is your last name  

For example:  

```
150901_assignment1_skinner.docx
150908_assignment2_skinner.do
```  

For assignments, the year, month and day should be the day the assignment is due.

# Honor Code

For this course, you are bound by the terms of the Peabody Honor
System. Any breach of academic honesty, including cheating,
plagiarism, or failing to report a known or suspected violation of the
Code will be reported to the Honor Council. In particular, papers must
assign credit to the sources you use. Material borrowed from
another---quotations, paraphrases, key words, or ideas---must be
credited following appropriate citation procedures (footnotes and
bibliography). As mentioned above, collaboration is permitted
on assignments but is not permitted on your summary paper and
codebook. If you have any doubts, please ask me for
clarification. Uncertainty about the application of the Honor Code
does not excuse a violation.
